# Random Password Generator
By: dopecello

## Description
This project took several hours to wrap my head around. Ultimately, this is a JS excercise which picks random characters out of different arrays when the user is prompted. The program concactenates the array to make a new one, which then ultimately spits out a password. There are a few tweaks I want to make to this since I have more time, but I will access a tutor for this to make sure I am getting a solid understanding.
